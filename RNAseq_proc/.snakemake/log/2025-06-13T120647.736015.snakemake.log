Error in rule download_sra:
    jobid: 1
    output: ../../SRX6800435/SRX6800435
    shell:
        bash scripts/wget.sh ../../SRX6800435/SRX6800435
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job download_sra since they might be corrupted:
../../SRX6800435/SRX6800435
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
